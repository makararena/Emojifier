# Emojifier
I successfully built two Emojifiers, showing significant achievements in natural language processing. The initial Emojifier set a strong foundation by harnessing the power of pre-trained word embeddings, serving as an impressive baseline model. In a noteworthy advancement, I also developed a second Emojifier.
